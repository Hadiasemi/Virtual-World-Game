Persian New Year.

1. How to trigger the event:
	To trigger the event place your mouse where you would like the
	upper left point of the flag to be. This will get rid off entities in a certain
        radius of the flag.

    After the event has triggered, players can click on objects to see their history and meaning.

2. What should happen when the event is triggered?

	The event causes an Iranian flag to drop, with a Haft-sin on the top. Additionally,
	Flag Guards guard the flag. Dancers move towards the fires to dance according to tradition.
	Blobs represent illness and are consumed by the fire.
	More information about the Haft-Sin can be read in-game through the terminal.

3. The affected Blobs turn into a diseased-red and sacrefice themselves to the Zoroastrinism 
	purification fire. Miners turn into Soldiers that also kill straggler blobs.

4. The new entity is a dancer who is supporting persian new year! They are randomly 
generated around the world, and are in search of the fires to jump over.

5. Nima Behmanesh, and Hadi Asemi


Notes:
	When an object is clicked on, you'll get a short little blirb about what that object represents.
