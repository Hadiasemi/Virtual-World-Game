# Iran Flag

In this project we made the Iran Flag with and the center represent Haft-sin. Haft-sin or Haft-seen (Persian: هفت‌سین‎) is an arrangement of seven symbolic items whose names start with the letter "س"
 pronounced as "seen" the 15th letter in the Persian alphabet; haft (هفت) is
Persian for seven. It is traditionally displayed at Nowruz, the Iranian New Year,
 which is celebrated on the day of the vernal equinox, marking the beginning of spring
on the Northern Hemisphere.
